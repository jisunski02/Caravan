    <string name="termsandconditions">
        The Rental Agreement. These Rental Terms and Conditions, the rental document you receive when you are given access to the car you are renting (the "Rental Contract") any additional agreement signed by you, any documents or agreements (or links to on-line documents or agreements) sent to you electronically in connection with your rental, the Privacy Notice, and the return receipt or record (the "Rental Receipt") with computed rental charges together constitute the "Rental Agreement" between yourself and Caravan. \n
            2. Your Rental. You rent from Caravan the car described on the Rental Contract, which rental is solely a transfer of possession, and not of ownership. You agree to the terms in the Rental Agreement provided any such term is not prohibited by the law of a jurisdiction covering this rental, in which case such law controls. “You” and “your” refer to the person who signs this agreement, “we”, “our” and “us” refer to Caravan. You also agree that you are not our agent for any purpose; and that you cannot assign delegate or transfer your obligations under the Rental Agreement and any discrete part thereof. \n
            3. Changes. Any change in the Rental Agreement or our rights must be in writing and signed by an authorized Caravan officer. You further agree that we have the unilateral right to change these Terms and Conditions from time to time either upon written notice to you, in paper or electronic form, or upon our posting such changes on the Caravan web site.  Such changes will apply to rentals that you reserve after such notice has been given, as indicated by the date of such notice, if sent in written form, or the date such changes are posted on the Caravan web site, which date will be indicated therein, without any requirement by you to sign the changed Terms and Conditions.  Changes to these Terms and Conditions will be posted as they occur on the Caravan web site at www.Caravan.com and will govern all rentals commencing after posting even if the terms provided at time of reserving the rental car are different. \n
            4. Meaning of Car. The word “car” in the Rental Agreement means the vehicle rented to you or its replacement and includes tires, tools, keys, key fobs, equipment, included and optional accessories, plates, documents, and any other products or property provided by Caravan with the vehicle and separately rented to you by Caravan unless otherwise explicitly specified in the Rental Agreement.
            \n
            5. Who May Drive The Car. You represent to Caravan that you are a capable and validly licensed driver and will remain a capable and validly licensed driver throughout the term of your rental. You agree that we have the right to verify that your license has been validly issued and is in good standing (not suspended, revoked or otherwise restricted in any way) as a condition precedent to each rental; and that we may in our sole discretion refuse to rent to you if your license is not in good standing. We reserve the right to deny rentals based upon (i) information about your license status, (ii) authenticity of your driver\'s license or other credentials, (iii) the inability to verify your identity or payment methods, (iv) your driving record provided by the Motor Vehicle Department of the jurisdiction that issued your license, or (v) any other information received from any other source in the business of validating an identity or the driver\'s license credential that we believe to be reliable. We reserve the right to validate your driving credentials and license good standing periodically without notice to you except as required by law. Except where otherwise specifically authorized by applicable law, only you, your spouse or domestic partner, or, if you rent from us under your employer\’s corporate account agreement, your employer or a regular fellow employee incidental to business duties may drive the car (each a "Permitted Driver"), but only with your prior permission. Any Permitted Driver must be at least 25 years old and must also be a capable and validly licensed driver at all times during which such person is operating the car.  Any person other than you or a Permitted Driver that operates the car must sign an additional driver form at the time of the rental. We may charge for each additional driver authorized to drive the car, which will be specified on the Rental Contract. You acknowledge that you will remain financially responsible under the Rental Agreement at all times even if the car is operated by a Permitted Driver or someone other than yourself.
